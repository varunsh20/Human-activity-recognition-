# Human-activity-recognition

This is a kaggle project. Here is the link to the kaggle dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones

The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.

The six activities includes 'Standing', 'Sitting', 'Laying', 'Walking', 'Walking_downstairs', 'Walking_upstairs'.

A multi layer perceptron network was trained. Here is the structure of the model
